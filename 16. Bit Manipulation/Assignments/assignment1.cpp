/* 
Question 1 : Write a Function to clear the range of bits from i to j in a given number. (i 
& j are counted backwards from the right end of the number) 
Examples : 
Input : num = 15, i = 1, j = 3 Output 
: 1 
Explanation : 
15 in binary form is => 00001111 [i=1st & j=3rd bit underlined] 
After bits are cleared, number will become 00000001 
Input : num = 31, i = 1, j = 3 Output 
: 17 
Note - Think about what type of bit mask is needed. It can also be a combination of 2 
numbers.

void clearBitsInRange(int num, int i, int j) {
    int leftmask = (~0) << (j+1);
    int rightmask = (1 << i) - 1;
    int mask = leftmask | rightmask;

    num = num & mask;
    cout << num << endl;
