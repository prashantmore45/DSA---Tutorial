Q(c). Algorithm A and B have a worst-case running time of O(n) and O(logn), respectively.
Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A.

A. True
B. False

Answer = Option B. -> false
The Big-O notation provides an asymptotic comparison in the running time of
algorithms. For n < n0, algorithm A might run faster than algorithm B, for instance.
